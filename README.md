Frontend Master Challlenge - Product list with cart hub.

Missing the add to cart button close to the image with the feature to add the number of desserts.

Does not look the best with the color choice(will be making it more aesthetically pleasing).

The cart container also does not scale with mobile.

Overall pretty fun challenge to do as my first one.
